  \resumeSummary{
    Dear Hiring Manager,\\ \bigskip
    I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Full-stack Software Engineering role at Flaconi. As a seasoned software
    engineer with experience in full lifecycle product development, I am confident that my technical understanding of cloud
    systems and project management skills make me a strong candidate for this position. \\ \medskip
    With more than 5 years of professional experience in programming languages such as Typescript/Javascript with Node.js
    and Dart, I have a strong foundation in back-end application development. I have also worked with different levels of test
    automation, including Jest, Cypress, Karma, and Selenium. Additionally, my experience with serverless architecture, AWS
    services, and infrastructure as code, such as Terraform and Ansible, makes me a valuable asset to your team.\\ \medskip
    I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work with a cross-functional team at Flaconi, where I can bring my
    passion for technology and my positive and result-oriented attitude to support the growth of the company. I am confident
    in my ability to design, develop, and optimize customer-facing solutions in an AWS cloud environment while ensuring
    performance, scalability, and testability. I also believe in the importance of sharing knowledge and learning from my peers,
    and I am eager to foster a culture of transparency and communication in your engineering department.\\ \medskip
    Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to join your international team and contribute
    to Flaconiâ€™s continued success. I have attached my resume and look forward to discussing my qualifications further.\\ \bigskip
    Sincerely,\\ \smallskip
    Oscar Castillejo
